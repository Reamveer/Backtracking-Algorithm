# Backtracking-Algorithm
Example of Backtracking Algorithm in C++

The program on the entrance receives three lines which every line is made up by upper letters of english alphabet.  
The second line contains the arithmetic sign at the beginning, informing us about what arithmetic operation is being performed.  

Code decrypts the puzzle by deciphering the numbers whose digits have been replaced with letters in arithmetic operations

EXAMPLE:  
In:      
CROW  
+CROW  
BIRDS   
Out:  
9032+9032=18064


Program only works for adding and subtracting ( + or - )  
The length of each word is not more than 200 characters.  
In the case of more than one correct anwser, the program prints the solution in reverse alphabetical order
